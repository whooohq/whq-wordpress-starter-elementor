"<p><strong>Important: Updates are coming soon for the Gravity Forms Google Analytics Add-On.</strong></p>\n"
"\t\t\t<p>On July 1, 2023, Google's Universal Analytics (UA) properties will stop processing any data. In order to address this, Gravity Forms will be releasing version 2.0 of the Google Analytics Add-On, which will send data to Google Analytics 4 (GA4) instead of UA.</p>\n"
"\t\t\t<p>We have disabled automatic updates for 2.0, as installing it will require you to make changes to ensure your data continues to send properly. For more information about this change, <a href=\"https://docs.gravityforms.com/google-universal-analytics-deprecation-warning\" target=\"_blank\">read what you need to do to prepare</a>.</p>"
